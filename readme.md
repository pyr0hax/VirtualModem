1. Install PPP:

Open a terminal and run:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ppp

Configure PPP:
Create a PPP configuration file. For example, you can create a file named /etc/ppp/options.myras:

    sudo nano /etc/ppp/options.myras

Add the following lines:

    lock
    local
    noauth
    nocrtscts
    idle 7200

Adjust the settings as needed. This configuration disables authentication, uses local mode, disables hardware flow control, and sets an idle timeout.

Create a User and Password:
Create a user for the RAS connection. Replace <username> and <password> with your desired values:

    sudo adduser <username>
    sudo passwd <username>

Create a PPP Connection:
Create a new PPP connection script. For example, create a file named /etc/ppp/peers/myras:

    sudo nano /etc/ppp/peers/myras
Add the following lines:

    connect "/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/chat-myras"
    /dev/virtualcom0
    115200
    defaultroute
    noipdefault
    usepeerdns
    persist
    lock
    nocrtscts
    hide-password
    novj
    nodetach
    noauth

Create a chat script for the connection in /etc/ppp/chat-myras:


    sudo nano /etc/ppp/chat-myras

Add the following lines:


    ABORT "BUSY"
    ABORT "NO CARRIER"
    TIMEOUT 30
    "" "ATZ"
    TIMEOUT 3
    OK "ATDT<your_sip_server>"
    CONNECT
    Replace <your_sip_server> with the appropriate SIP server address.

Start the PPP Connection:
Run the following command to start the PPP connection:


    sudo pon myras
Adjust IP Routing and Firewall:
Adjust IP routing and firewall settings as needed to allow traffic from the PPP connection.

2. Adjust the Script for Virtual COM Ports on Linux:

For virtual COM ports on Linux, you can use the tty0tty tool (also known as tty0tty or com0com for Linux) to create pairs of virtual serial ports. The tty0tty tool creates a pair of connected virtual serial ports that you can use like regular serial ports. You can install tty0tty using your package manager.

Install tty0tty (tty0tty or com0com for Linux):
Open a terminal and run:


    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install tty0tty

Load the Kernel Modules:
Load the kernel modules required for tty0tty to work:


    sudo modprobe tty0tty

Create Virtual COM Ports:
Run the following command to create a pair of virtual serial ports (e.g., COM10 and COM11):


    sudo setserial /dev/ttyS10 port 32 ttyS11 port 33

Adjust the port numbers as needed.

Then update the config.ini file to reflect the correct Port numbers used with the correct extensions setup.

Open a Terminal:
Open a terminal window on your Linux system. You can usually find the terminal in the applications menu or by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T.

Update Package Lists:
Run the following command to update the package lists:


    sudo apt update
This will ensure that you have the latest information about available packages.

Install PJSUA:
Run the following command to install PJSUA:


    sudo apt install libpjsua2
This command installs the PJSUA library along with its development headers. The libpjsua2 package includes the PJSUA command-line tool and the necessary libraries.

Test PJSUA:
After the installation is complete, you can test PJSUA by running the following command:

    pjsua2
